#  Reference:
#
#  Carl Morris. "Was Ty Cobb ever a TRUE .400 hitter?"  ASA JSM Lecture, August 18, 1982. Cincinnati.
#
#  Ty Cobb's largest numbers of "atbats" were 605 in season 3 (1907), 591 in season 7 (1911), and 625
#     in season 20 (1924).
#  The "seasons" variable: [1:24] represents a pure "linear trend" effect within the fitted model. Ty
#     Cobb's highest "batavg" was 0.4196277 in 1911 (season 7.)
#  CMspl = Carl Morris' Piecewise Linear Spline term stays at 0 for seasons [1:6] then increases linearly [1:18]
#     in seasons [7:24]. Its three "Knots" thus occur in seasons: 1 (1905), 6 (1910) and 24 (1928).

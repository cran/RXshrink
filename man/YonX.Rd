\title{Maximum Likelihood (ML) Shrinkage in Simple Linear Regression}
\description{
  Compute and display Normal-theory ML Shrinkage statistics when a y-Outcome Variable
  is regressed upon a SINGLE x-Variable (i.e. p = 1). Since the OLS (BLUE) estimate is
  a scalar in this case, the MSE optimal Shrinkage factor, dMSE, is a Scalar value that
  is both less than +1 as well as greater than 0. The m-Extent of overall Optimal
  Shrinkage corresponding to this solution is marked by the "purple" vertical
  dashed-line on all TRACE displays for YonX() Shrinkage.
}
\usage{
  YonX(form, data, delmax = 0.999999)
}
\arguments{
  \item{form}{A regression formula [y ~ x] suitable for use with lm().}
  \item{data}{Data frame containing observations on both variables in the formula.}
  \item{delmax}{Maximum allowed value for Shrinkage delta-factor that is strictly less
   than 1. (default = 0.999999, which prints as 1 when rounded to fewer than 6 decimal
   places.)}
}
\details{Since only a single X-variable is being used, these "simple" models are
  (technically) NOT "Ill-conditioned". Of course, the Y-variable may be nearly
  multi-collinear with the given X-variable, but this simply means that the model
  then has low "lack-of-fit". In fact, the OLS estimate can never have the "wrong"
  numerical sign in these simple p = 1 models!  Furthermore, since "risk" estimates
  are scalar-valued, no "exev" TRACE is routinely displayed; its content duplicates
  information in the "rmse" TRACE. Similarly, no "infd" TRACE is displayed because
  any "inferior direction" COSINE would be either: +1 ("upwards") when an estimate
  is decreasing, or -1 ("downwards") when an estimate is increasing. The m-Extent
  of shrinkage is varied from 0.000 to 1.000 in 1000 "steps" of size 0.001.

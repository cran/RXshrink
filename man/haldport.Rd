\title{Portland Cement data of Hald(1952)}
\description{Heat evolved during setting of 13 cement mixtures of four (or five) ingredients.
 The first four ingredient percentages appear to be "rounded down" to a full integer. The fifth
 integer percentage of "other" material assures that the five percentages sum to exactly 100\%.
 However, the "centered" X-matrix resulting from inclusion of all five ingredients would then be
 Singular (rank=4). In other words, regressing any y-Outcome on only the first four X-variables
 yields an "ill-conditioned" model that, while having numerical "full rank"=4, actually suffers
 a effective "rank deficiency" of at least mcal = 1.

\usage{data(haldport)}
\details{The (RXshrink) haldport data are identical to the (MASS) cement data except for
 variable names and inclusion of the "other" X-variable.
